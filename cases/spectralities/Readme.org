* Spectra, instabilities and max-cuts

=m8-degradation.jl= --- the code used for preparing the figure showing
the variation of instabilities in connected Erdos-Renyi graphs.

=small_success_anisotropy.ipynb= --- the notebook for the numerical analysis of a
small graph: three dynamical regimes and the success probability.
